# Definition:
    # There are 3 different types of numeric types in python
    # 1 . Integer
    # 2 . Float
    # 3 . complex

    # Variables of numeric type is created we we assign values to its , like this
    # a = 10

    # To verify the type of object we use type function

# 1 . Integer :
    # Interger is a whole number of positive or negative values without having decimal and can be 
    # of unlimited length

# x = 1
# y = 52489674751
# z = -250


# print(x)
# print(y)
# print(z)

# 2 . Float :
    # Float is a number containing positive and negative values with 1 or more decimal values

# x = 2.5
# y = -35.95
# z = 2.2

# print(x)
# print(y)
# print(z)

    # Float can also be  scientific number with an 'e' to indicate the power of 10

# x = 35e3
# y = 12E4
# z = -87.7e100

# print(x)
# print(y)
# print(z)

# 3 . Complex :
    # Complex numbers are written with a 'j' as imaginary part

# x = 3 + 5j
# y = 8j
# z = -65j

# print(x)
# print(y)
# print(z)
