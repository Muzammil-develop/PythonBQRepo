# WHILE LOOPS :
    # Python has 2 primitive loop commands .

# 1. While loops
# 2. for loops

# WHILE LOOP :
    # With while loop we can execute a set of statement as long as condition is True

# i = 1
# while i < 6:
#     print(i)
#     i += 1

    # Remember to increment i otherwise loop will continue forever.
    # The while loop required relevant variables to be ready , in this example we need to define an
# indexing variable i , which is set to 1.

#  BREAK STATEMENT : 
    # With the break statement we can stop the loop even if the while condition is True

# i = 1
# while i < 6:
#     print(i)
#     if i == 3:
#         break
#     i += 1

# CONTINUE STATEMENT :
    # with the continue statement we can stop the current iteration and continue with the next .

# i = 0
# while i < 6:
#     i += 1 
#     if i == 3:
#         continue
#     print(i)

# ELSE STAEMENT :
    # with the else statement we can run a block of code once when condition no longer is True.

# i = 1
# while i < 6:
#     print(i)
#     i += 1

# else:
#     print('i is no longer less than  6')
