# Specify Variable Type :
    # There was a time when we want to specify the type on to a variable .This can be done with casting 
    # Python is an object oriented language and as such it uses classes to define data types including
    # its primitive datatypes .
    # Casting in python is done using constructor functions

# 1 . int():
    # construct an integer number from integer literal , a float literal (by removing all decimals) 
    # ,or a string literal (providing the strings that represents whole number)
# 2 . float():
    # constructs a float number from integer literal , a float literal or a string literal (providing
    # the string represents a float or an integer )
# 3 . str():
    #  contruct a strings from a wide variety of datatypes including strings , integer literals and
    # float literals 

# x = 15
# y = 25.1
# z = 's1'

# print(int(y))
# print(float(x))
# print(str(x))
